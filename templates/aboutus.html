                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is simple: to break down the language barriers that prevent citizens from understanding their rights and accessing essential services. We believe that information is a fundamental right, and it should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their literacy level or familiarity with complex terminology.</p>

                    <h2>The Problem: The Language Wall</h2>
                    <p>In India, critical information is often locked away in dense, bureaucratic language. Government schemes, legal notices, and official forms are filled with jargon that can be intimidating and confusing for the average person. This "language wall" creates a significant gap, preventing millions of people from benefiting from the very systems designed to serve them.</p>
